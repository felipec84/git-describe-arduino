# Git-describe for Arduino

This script provides an automatic versioning system for Arduino sketches based on git tag. This approach guarantees a strong relationship between source code and the compiled firmware. Moreover, it will enforce the developer to maintain meaningful tags during the project development.

## Features

- it defines the constant GIT_VERSION, visible in your source code, containing version details
- No extraordinary hacking to Arduino IDE
- Available for Window and Linux (MAC OS will be tested)

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE 1.8.9, 1.8.11 or newer
- Git

> NOTE: on Arduino IDE 1.8.10 the script doesn't work because a regression bug. I didn't test this method on versions older than 1.8.9.

## Installation
  
  1. Clone this repository (e.g. you may locate it inside `/path/to/arduino-workspace/tools/`).
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/fabiuz7/git-describe-arduino.git
     ```

  2. **On Linux**, make script executable:  
     ```
     cd /path/to/arduino-workspace/tools/git-describe-arduino
     chmod 755 git-version.sh
     ```
    
     (no need to modify global path)  
     
     **On Window**, add git-version.bat to global path ([Add script to global path](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html)).

  3. Add this script to prebuild hooks of Arduino toolchain. Created if not exist the file `platform.txt` inside `/path/to/arduino-application/hardware/`. On Windows, append the following line:  
     ```
     recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern=git-version.bat "{build.source.path}/src" "{build.path}/sketch/src"
     ```  
     On Mac/Linux, append the following line:  
     ```
     recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern=/path/to/arduino-workspace/tools/git-version.sh "{build.source.path}/src" "{build.path}/sketch/src"
     ```

## Installation (python version)
  
I have some problems in windows with the bash version, when building Arduino simply opened the .sh file to edit and din't execute it.

Instead of spend time debugging it, I created a python version that works fine in Windows 11.

  1. Install python (in windows)
     ```
     https://www.python.org/
     ```

  2. **On Linux**, make script executable:  
     ```
     cd /path/to/arduino-workspace/tools/git-describe-arduino
     chmod 755 git-version.py
     ```
    
     (no need to modify global path)  
     
     **On Window**, add folder to global path (https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) or you could also copy it to you bin folder.

     I have a problem when after a reboot windows didn't want to run the python file and it tried to open it with my editor, it was working before so my guess is that some part of windows disable the script execution, in order to fix this I used 'pyinstaller'  in order to have an .exe file from my .py:

     ```
     cd \path\to\arduino-workspace\tools\git-describe-arduino
     python -m pip install pyinstaller
     pyinstaller.exe .\git-version.py --onefile
     cp .\dist\pyinstaller.exe ${HOME}\bin\
     ```

     Finaly change pyinstaller.py for pyinstaller.exe in pyinstaller.bat


  3. Add this script to prebuild hooks of Arduino toolchain. Created if not exist the file `platform.txt` inside `/path/to/arduino-application/hardware/`. On Windows, append the following line:  
     ```
     recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern=git-version.bat "{build.source.path}/src" "{build.path}/sketch/src"
     ```  
     On Mac/Linux, append the following line:  
     ```
     recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern=/path/to/arduino-workspace/tools/git-version.sh "{build.source.path}/src" "{build.path}/sketch/src"
     ```

## Usage

To configure your sketch you need to complete few steps:

  1. Create `src` folder in the sketch folder.
  2. Create `git-version.h` in `src` folder. Leave the file empty because it is overwritten by the script.
  3. If your repository is not under git, initialize a reposititory for the sketch and do the first commit.
  3. Modify your sketch to include `git-version.h` and print the current version. Example:
      
     ```cpp
     #include "src/git-version.h"

     void setup() {
       Serial.begin(115200);
       Serial.println();
       Serial.print("Git version: ");
       Serial.println(GIT_VERSION);
     }

     void loop() {
       // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: 
  
     }
     ```

  4. Compile and upload to see the result. Good versioning!

NOTE: GIT_VERSION is a string composed by 3 dash-separated fields:

- `lastest-git-tag`: printed if a tag exists
- `number-of-commits-since-latest-tag`-`last-commits-short-hash`: printed if `number-of-commits-since-latest-tag` is not *0*
- "dirty": printed if the working directory is dirty

Example: 0.3.0-8-cc68a61-dirty

## Motivation

I was working on multiple projects simultaneously and it was difficult to remember the state of applications after a few months, especially when firmware were deployed on many microcontrollers. Hence, retrieving the precise version from compiled firmware became mandatory. Also, this practice seems a rule of thumb in many toolchains and environments. This script took inspiration from similar projects such as [git-describe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-describe) for JavaScript and NPM and [GitInfo](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GitInfo/) for C# and Visual Studio.
